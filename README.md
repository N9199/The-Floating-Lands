# The Floating Lands
The Floating Lands is the name of a fantasy world which has two peculiar characteristics, it's compromised by floating islands from varying sizes and it roams across the multiverse in it's own pocket dimension, which connects with whichever world its visiting at the moment. It's the also the world where I run D&D campaigns.

## This Repo
The idea is that I'll have a place where I can get info out of for whichever campaign I'm running at the moment, and it'll be easy to see how it has been shaped with the passing of time.
