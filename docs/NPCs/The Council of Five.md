## The Five Sages

### Elora Aeran
###### School of Transmutation (Nova Aurora)
An elf, who might as well be immortal, she founded The City of Aeria. She loves magic, and lives for magic, as so, she formed the council of five so she could focus on research. She leads the research team on [Nova Aurora](../Factions/The&#32;City&#32;of&#32;Aeria/Nova&#32;Aurora). Little is known of her personal life, other than her familial relation with Naexi, but there are abundant rumours; some say she has a secret lover, others that she's still pure, and still others think that she's lost her true love long ago. Contrasting her personal life, her academic life is well known by those in Aeria, her main research area is transmutation, though she's a master of most known magic.

### Naexi Sylwynn
###### School of Evocation (Zephyr)
Aeria's supreme commander, she leads the mage army, navy and air-force. She swore to protect The City of Aeria, as Elora took her in and raised her, she know protects her home and the life project of Elora. As supreme commander, she has the biggest fire power and battle experience on Aeria, and maybe even in all of the realm, as a mage she researches evocation magic in between training the military forces. She adopted Traker, a tielfling, who escaped from the grasp of the order of [New Helios](../Factions/New&#32;Helios/Summary), he now teaches at Ripyce and sometimes serves as an sword fighting instructor for the army.

### Faelar Herris
###### School of Enchantment (Aeria, External)
The one who faces the outside world in place of the council, as such he's seldom on Aeria, but whenever he's present he teaches at Ripyce and helps his various apprentices, a charismatic leader who's highly trusted by Elora. As a researcher of the school of enchantment and a half-elf, he only feels at home on Aeria, even his home city, [Orion](../Factions/Orion/Summary), won't accept him. In his travels, sometimes adventurers see him by chance, and he helps them on their current quest in exchange on info on the world. It's rumoured that he leads the biggest spy network of the Floating Lands, but no one has been able to prove a single thing.

### Yasuhiro <!--Kitsune-->
###### School of Divination (Aeria, Internal)
A divine being, she's said to be the familiar of Elora, but that couldn't be further from the truth. While travelling through this plane, Yasuhiro met Elora and became friends with her when they realized their mutual love of magic. Later, she found her place on Aeria, and as a favour to Elora she deals with the internal management of Aeria, which is easy for a divine messenger. In her free time she furthers divination magic and helps Elora at Nova Aurora.

### Ko <!--Neko-->
###### School of Abjuration (Ripyce)
The headmaster of Ripyce, and a cat. He's actually the familiar of Elora, but because of a freak magic accident he gained immortality, immense intelligence and the ability to change form into a catboy. After realizing that, Elora taught him magic, and his talent bloomed. He's been in charge of Ripyce, since it's inception, dealing with administrative work, research and teaching. Whenever he has time he talks with Yasuhiro about the alumni, the students and Elora. It's clear he cares his students and Elora, and some even say that he has something with Yasuhiro. As the headmaster, and familiar of Elora, he looks for ways to protect them, as such,he researches abjuration.
