##### Master of Necromancy and Conjuration

Once a upon a time, she was a lich, a powerful undead with one and only one objective, gain more knowledge. She envied and admired [Elora](Leaders_of_Aeria/Elora_Aeran), as someone who was living her dream, but Celess was only a human, not an elf who's immortal, as such she searched for forbidden magic, dark magic, by which she became a lich.

After gaining lichdom, she became an outcast, even so, she was happy, she had finally gotten immortality, and she used her first few hundred years to know even more. That was, until Elora found out, and sought her. The last time they have seen each other they were master and apprentice, but more importantly friends, now distraught over her choices, Elora gave Celess the choice to undo her lichdom, or to perish as a great danger. She trusted Elora, and took the former option. After a long ritual, she lived, she became human again, or at least something similar, as her time as a lich had taken a toll on her soul and infused it with dark magic. She became something between an undead and a human, she retained her immortality, but not her hunger for power.

She now lives as a traveller, every so often going back to [Aeria](../Factions/The_City_of_Aeria/Summary), and helping towns and travellers alike, while learning more magic.
