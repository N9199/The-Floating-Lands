There's a rumour afloat in the floating lands, about a glittering city in the middle of the great "TBD" desert. A place of indulgence and lawlessness, where people lose themselves to cheap sin. A place of riches and high tension, but adventurers beware, as others tell tales of lost time and lost valuables.
