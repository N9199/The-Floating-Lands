# {{page.title}}

A former empire, named after the capital, and one of the only nations which has more than one city. The current emperor, Giraldus the fourth, has recently taken the throne, after a bloody civil war, as such it's not clear what's gonna happen with them.

## Cities

### [Imperos](Imperos)

The eponymous city, also often called the city of the great game. A place where the line between ally and enemy is often blurry, though sometimes the only ones you can trust are your enemies, as Giraldus learned. The game has been won, or so it seems, as the balance of power is fickle, and anything might tilt it again.

### [Nova Spheris](Nova_Spheris)

Sometimes called the City of Steel or the City of Gold, Nova Spheris is the financial powerhouse of Imperos. While technically controlled by Imperos, the amount of money that is moved daily through this city makes that impossible in practice, as money rules this city.

### [The City of Iahu](The_City_of_Iahu)

Better known as the city of tragedies, as its been plagued by them since its inception, but its inhabitants carry on, having learned that there's always a next day. This city is what has triggered the last three power struggles on Imperos, as different disasters struck. At this moment, the only reason nations want this city is because of its impressive natural resources as within its borders it houses the biggest forges and mines on Mistral, while having natural defenses against invaders.

## Towns

### New Ethos

A town dedicated to feeding the empire, be it naturally, through magic or both. A floating island fully used for farming. It's hard to get to it, as it flies above Imperos itself.

### Cloudhelm

An outpust far away from the mainland, run by the Imperos military and royal magicians, a state secret. Only a the ones in power know about it, and they know they better keep it a secret, because if it fell on enemy hands the amount of damage dealt to Imperos would be as much if not more than if it lost Iahu. But while everyone does its best to keep its existence hidden, rumours of the place do exist, so much that its become a synonym with state secrets and conspiracy theories.
