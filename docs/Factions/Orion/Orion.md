# {{page.title}}

A city managed by elders, and lead by an ancient dragon. As one of the oldest, if not the oldest city on Mistral, it hides many secrets, as such scholars, looters and even adventurers, come for the chance to find forgotten artifacts, ancient spells or powerful weapons.

## Important Citizens

### The Council of Wisdom

The public leaders of Orion, as part of the initiation they are told the biggest secret of the city: Who's the golden dragon in their coat of arms? As Avor presents himself. They have varying ages, but all of them are considered elders of their species. The council does not have a set size, it has varied from 2 to 14 people, at the present there are 6 elders on the council. The management of Orion is divided such that each elder is in charge of an area, though technically every single one can take exert on every area. Currently the division is as follows:

- Courts
- Military
- Magic/Archeology

### [Avor, Gentle Mind](../../NPCs/Avor)

An ancient gold dragon, he lived through the fall of Orion, and saw the suffering it caused, as such he decided to help & guide the remaining inhabitants. He's the true governor of Orion, but he's worked hard to keep it a secret, as such anyone who knows either highly respects him or fears him. One of his only friends is [Elora](<../../NPCs/Elora_Aeran>), as both have helped each other in times of need through the centuries. His lair is deep under the city, but his influence spreads to all the city.

### Wolfram the Fifth, Marquis of House Spinella

Current head of The Society of the Ancient Quill, Lafia's√ç arcane archeology research group. As a noble and a local he looks down on Lox and his research group. He has a lot of important discoveries under his name, and even more secret ones. A great wizard and tracker, he's an alumni of Lafia, and sometimes a teacher. He doesn't believe the rumours of Aeria, because the most important magic city must be Orion.
