## Towns

### Cerulis
An old agricultural outpost of Orion, most food on Orion comes from here, but it's really close to [Imperos](../Imperos/Summary), as such there's an important military presence in the area. To defend the area, the town was rebuilt from the ground up, it has with four different concentric walls and three different areas, as well as important magical wards.

### Ockford
The town closest to Orion, it also gives a great outlook to the valley where Orion itself is located. Ockford, is a town no redeeming qualities other than its strategic location, though the marvelous view and closeness to real civilization has persuaded many nobles from other lands to come and build a winter retreat, this has made it a popular place to hold negotiations between allies of Orion.

### Paledo
The town which marks the end of [New Helios's](../New&#32;Helios/Summary) influence, many important mages have been born in this town, so many that people suspect the influence of a God. Though the closeness to New Helios makes it so some claim that it must be that Helios has blessed this area, and as such, it must be under the control of the Helios Order. While locals know that this is sacred site for Iesis, the patron of magic and the god of the arcane.
